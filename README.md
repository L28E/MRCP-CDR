# Multiple Rotating Clock Phase Architecture for Clock and Data Recovery

An implentation of the CDR architecture described by Ahmed and Kwasniewski (See [references](#references))

## Dependencies

Simulation uses Icarus Verilog, and the waveforms are viewed with GTKWave. Both of which have prepackaged binaries.
